{"name":"Generator-RAMLAPI","tagline":"A Yeoman Generator to produce RAML API projects","body":"# Generator-RAMLAPI\r\n\r\n`generator-ramlapi` is a generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) that generates a project scaffold for API development in RAML and JSON Schema.\r\n\r\n*Features*\r\n\r\n* RAML validation\r\n* RAML HTML document generation (via RAML2HTML) with improved HTML templates\r\n* JSON Schema validation\r\n* Example validation against JSON Schema\r\n\r\n## Getting Started:\r\n\r\n*Installing Dependencies*\r\n\r\nInstall [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/download/). On OSX, installation via [NVM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nvm) and/or [Homebrew](brew.sh) is highly recommended.\r\n\r\nUpdate [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com). Depending on your installation, you may need to use `sudo` for the following commands.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install -g npm\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall Yeoman, [Gulp](gulpjs.com) and generator-ramlapi:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install -g yo gulp generator-ramlapi\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Beginning a project\r\n\r\nCreate a directory for your RAML API project and `cd` into it.\r\n\r\nRun the generator like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nyo ramlapi\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generator will ask you a number of questions. Answer these as completely as you can, but all can be changed later if need be.\r\n\r\nAfter the questions, the generator will install the NPM dependencies for your project.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo run the validation and build HTML docs, simply run the command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngulp\r\n```\r\n\r\nValidates the JSON Schema, RAML, and produces documentation in the `public/` directory.\r\n\r\n### Project Structure\r\n\r\n* *`*.raml`*: files located in the root directory are documented.\r\n* *`raml/`*: RAML fragment files referenced by the primary RAML.\r\n* *`schema/`*: JSON Schema files referenced in RAML files (or fragments).\r\n* *`examples/`*: JSON example files for the JSON Schema.\r\n* *`public/`*: a folder suitable to publish to a GitHub project page with generated documentation.\r\n* *`templates/`*: contains the RAML2HTML templates that are used instead of the default templates.\r\n\r\n### RAML Notes\r\n\r\nRAML files should not include JSON Schema directly, but should instead use `!include` to include them from the `schema/` directory. This isn't essential - just a best practice.\r\n\r\n[raml2html](https://github.com/kevinrenskers/raml2html) is used to generate the documentation HTML.\r\n\r\n### Schema Notes\r\n\r\nSchema files are expected to be stored in the `schema/` directory.\r\n\r\nExample files are stored in the `examples/` directory.\r\n\r\nExample files that are included in a RAML media type section with a schema are validated against that schema.\r\n\r\n## Generator improvements to come\r\n\r\n1. scaffold the github page\r\n2. gulp-watch support\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nApache-2.0\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
